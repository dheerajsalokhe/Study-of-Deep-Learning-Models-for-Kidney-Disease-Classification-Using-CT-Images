# Study-of-Deep-Learning-Models-for-Kidney-Disease-Classification-Using-CT-Images
Deep learning models (InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, ResNet50 and ViT models) are used to classify kidney diseases (Normal, Cyst, Tumor, Stone) from CT images. Grad-CAM visualizations improve interpretability. InceptionV3 achieved 99.82% accuracy.
