## üß† Abstract

Kidney disease is a growing global health issue caused by factors like diabetes and hypertension. This project applies deep learning to classify kidney conditions‚ÄîNormal, Cyst, Tumor, and Stone‚Äîusing CT scan images. Five deep learning models (InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, Vision Transformer) were evaluated. The best-performing model, **InceptionV3**, achieved **100% test accuracy**. Grad-CAM visualizations enhance model transparency.

## üîç Grad-CAM for Model Interpretability

Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) was used to visually explain the decisions made by each deep learning model. This interpretability enhances trust among medical professionals by showing where the model focused its attention when predicting kidney diseases.

### üí° Key Steps:

- **Gradient Backpropagation**: Calculated gradients of the predicted class with respect to the last convolutional layer.  
- **Feature Map Weighting**: Applied these gradients to the layer's activations to generate a coarse heatmap.  
- **Overlay Visualization**: Superimposed the heatmap onto the original CT image to highlight the most influential regions.  

### ‚úÖ Insights:

- Grad-CAM heatmaps consistently focused on anatomically relevant regions associated with renal pathologies.  
- For example, cyst predictions aligned with visibly abnormal circular regions in the kidney.  
- Helped validate and fine-tune model performance through better preprocessing and training adjustments.  
- Enhances transparency and trust in AI-assisted diagnosis in healthcare.
